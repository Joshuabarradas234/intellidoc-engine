# Testing & Validation

**Purpose:** Prove the API works end-to-end by executing real requests and verifying that each component (from request handling to data storage and monitoring) functions correctly.

# üîß API Testing Setup

## Postman Configuration (URL, Headers, JSON Body)

To test the API's end-to-end functionality, we used Postman to simulate client requests. We configured a new POST request in Postman with the following details:

- **URL:** `https://45002xf9i1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/receipts`
- **Headers:** Included `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body:** Selected **raw** JSON format and provided a JSON payload representing the receipt data:

```json
{
  "documentName": "receipt1.txt",
  "receiptText": "Milk 2.99, Bread 1.49"
}
üì∏ Screenshot 1 (Postman Request Setup):


What this shows:

POST method configuration targeting the correct API Gateway endpoint
Required headers including Content-Type: application/json
JSON body structure with documentName and receiptText fields
Postman interface ready to send the test request
Clean workspace setup for API testing
üöÄ API Response Testing
Example POST Request ‚Üí Response
With Postman configured, we executed the POST request to the /receipts endpoint. The API call succeeded with an HTTP 200 OK response, confirming the request was processed without errors. The response body returned by the API contained a success message and the new receipt ID.

Example response:

json
Copy
{
  "message": "Receipt saved successfully!",
  "receiptId": "receipt1.txt#2025-08-20T08:32:10.6956"
}
Performance Metrics:

Response Time: 565ms (well within acceptable limits)
Response Size: 537 B
Status: 200 OK
Success Rate: 100% during testing
üì∏ Screenshot 2: Postman Response (200 OK)


What this shows:

Successful HTTP 200 OK response from the API
JSON response body with success message and generated receipt ID
Response time of 565ms indicating good performance
Response size of 537 bytes showing efficient data transfer
Green status indicator confirming successful API call
Complete request/response cycle working as expected
üîç Data Retrieval Testing
GET/Search Request Example ‚Üí Response
After inserting a receipt, we tested retrieval by performing a GET request to the search endpoint:

bash
Copy
GET /receipts?query=Milk
Example search response:

json
Copy
[
  {
    "receiptId": "receipt1.txt#2025-08-20T08:32:10.6956",
    "documentName": "receipt1.txt",
    "receiptText": "Milk 2.99, Bread 1.49",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-20T08:32:10.6956"
  }
]
We also tested a direct GET by ID:

bash
Copy
GET /receipt/receipt1.txt#2025-08-20T08:32:10.6956
This returned the complete stored receipt record from DynamoDB, confirming data persistence and retrieval functionality.

‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling Validation
Comprehensive Error Testing
We verified that the API responds correctly to invalid requests:

Missing Fields: Returns 400 Bad Request with validation error
Invalid Format: Returns 400 Bad Request if JSON is malformed
Not Found: Returns 404 Not Found for non-existent receipt IDs
Oversized Payload: Returns 413 Payload Too Large for documents exceeding limits
These checks confirm the API gracefully handles incorrect or unexpected inputs with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

üìä CloudWatch Monitoring Validation
Real-time Metrics Tracking
The Lambda backend publishes custom metrics to CloudWatch for comprehensive monitoring:

InsertSuccess ‚Äì increments on successful receipt insertions
InsertError ‚Äì increments on failed insert attempts
After our POST request, InsertSuccess increased by 1.04, and InsertError remained 0, confirming the API worked as expected and monitoring captured the event accurately.

Metrics Details:

Metric Name: InsertSuccess
Count: 1.04 successful operations
Time Range: 1 day view
Timestamp: 2025-08-20 08:30 UTC
Region: us-east-1 (N. Virginia)

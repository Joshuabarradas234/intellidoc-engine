# Testing & Validation

**Purpose:** Prove the API works end-to-end by executing real requests and verifying that each component (from request handling to data storage and monitoring) functions correctly.

---

## Postman Setup (URL, Headers, JSON Body)

To test the API's end-to-end functionality, we used Postman to simulate client requests. We configured a new POST request in Postman with the following details:

- **URL:** `https://45002xf9i1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/receipts`
- **Headers:** Included `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body:** Selected **raw** JSON format and provided a JSON payload representing the receipt data:

```json
{
  "documentName": "receipt1.txt",
  "receiptText": "Milk 2.99, Bread 1.49"
}
Screenshot 1: Postman Request Setup


Shows the POST method, target URL, required headers, and example JSON body configured in Postman.

Example POST Request â†’ Response
With Postman configured, we executed the POST request to the /receipts endpoint. The API call succeeded with an HTTP 200 OK response, confirming the request was processed without errors. The response body returned by the API contained a success message and the new receipt ID.

Example response:

json
Copy
{
  "message": "Receipt saved successfully!",
  "receiptId": "receipt1.txt#2025-08-20T08:32:10.6956"
}
Performance Metrics:

Response Time: 565ms
Response Size: 537 B
Status: 200 OK
Screenshot 2: Postman Response (200 OK)


Shows the JSON response in Postman with a success message and receipt ID, along with response time and status code.

GET/Search Request Example â†’ Response
After inserting a receipt, we tested retrieval by performing a GET request to the search endpoint:

bash
Copy
GET /receipts?query=Milk
Example search response:

json
Copy
[
  {
    "receiptId": "receipt1.txt#2025-08-20T08:32:10.6956",
    "documentName": "receipt1.txt",
    "receiptText": "Milk 2.99, Bread 1.49",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-20T08:32:10.6956"
  }
]
We also tested a direct GET by ID:

bash
Copy
GET /receipt/receipt1.txt#2025-08-20T08:32:10.6956
This returned the complete stored receipt record from DynamoDB.

Error Handling Test
We verified that the API responds correctly to invalid requests:

Missing Fields: Returns 400 Bad Request with validation error
Invalid Format: Returns 400 Bad Request if JSON is malformed
Not Found: Returns 404 Not Found for non-existent receipt IDs
Oversized Payload: Returns 413 Payload Too Large for documents exceeding limits
These checks confirm the API gracefully handles incorrect or unexpected inputs.

Validation in CloudWatch Metrics
The Lambda backend publishes custom metrics to CloudWatch:

InsertSuccess â€“ increments on successful receipt insertions
InsertError â€“ increments on failed insert attempts
After our POST request, InsertSuccess increased by 1.04, and InsertError remained 0, confirming the API worked as expected and monitoring captured the event.

Metrics Details:

Metric Name: InsertSuccess
Count: 1.04 successful operations
Time Range: 1 day view
Timestamp: 2025-08-20 08:30 UTC
Screenshot 3: CloudWatch Metrics After Test


Shows the CloudWatch dashboard with InsertSuccess incremented after running the Postman test, confirming successful document processing and storage.

Test Environment Configuration
AWS Region: us-east-1
API Gateway: Production stage deployment
Lambda Runtime: Python 3.9
DynamoDB: On-demand billing mode
CloudWatch: Standard metrics enabled with custom metrics
Summary
This testing proves that the IntelliDoc Engine API:

âœ… Accepts and processes valid requests with proper JSON formatting
âœ… Stores and retrieves data successfully in DynamoDB
âœ… Handles errors gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes
âœ… Monitors operations effectively through CloudWatch metrics
âœ… Performs within acceptable limits for production workloads

The end-to-end validation confirms the system is ready for production deployment and can handle real-world document processing workflows reliably.

IntelliDoc Engine — AI‑Powered Document Processing on AWS

One‑liner: Upload any receipt or document -> extract vendor, date, and items -> search everything instantly.

Executive Summary

IntelliDoc Engine is a serverless AI‑powered document processing pipeline that automatically extracts text from uploaded documents, classifies them, and makes the content immediately searchable.

It showcases a full‑stack AWS solution using Lambda, Textract, DynamoDB, OpenSearch, API Gateway, and Cognito for secure, scalable handling of documents.

Problem: Manual document processing is slow, error‑prone, and makes it difficult to search through large archives of files.
Solution: Automate ingestion, OCR text extraction, and indexing into a searchable database.
Outcome: A scalable, pay‑per‑use system that processes documents in real time, enabling instant keyword search.

AWS Services Overview
Service	Role in IntelliDoc Engine
Amazon S3	Storage for uploaded documents; triggers OCR workflow
AWS Lambda	Orchestrates processing; serverless compute
Amazon Textract	AI OCR to extract text from documents
Amazon DynamoDB	Stores extracted text + metadata
Amazon OpenSearch	Indexes text for fast keyword searches
Amazon API Gateway	REST endpoints (/upload, /search)
Amazon Cognito	(Optional) Authentication for secure API access
Amazon CloudWatch	Logging, metrics, alarms
AWS X‑Ray	Distributed tracing for performance analysis
Key Features
Automated OCR & Text Extraction via Textract with clean, structured storage for search.
Document classification stub (upgradeable to ML models).
Serverless processing pipeline that auto‑scales with no server management.
Scalable storage & search with DynamoDB + OpenSearch.
Secure API with Auth via Cognito (optional).
Monitoring & observability via CloudWatch and X‑Ray.
IAM & least privilege with security best practices applied.

Why it matters: Quickly search and analyze invoices/receipts across large archives without manual review.

Quick Setup Guide

Prerequisites

AWS Account
AWS CLI or Console Access
(Optional) Node.js/NPM for frontend
(Optional) AWS SAM CLI / Terraform for IaC deployment

Deployment Steps

Provision AWS resources — S3, DynamoDB, OpenSearch, API Gateway, Cognito (optional).
Deploy Lambda functions — upload_handler, textract_processor, indexer, search_api.
Connect Lambdas to events — S3 triggers, API Gateway routes.
Configure frontend — update aws-config.js.
Test the solution — upload document, search keyword.
How to Use

Upload Document

curl -X POST "<API_URL>/upload" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/document.pdf"


Search Document

curl "<API_URL>/search?query=invoice"

Testing & Results
Verified with Postman (end‑to‑end upload + search).
CloudWatch logs confirm successful Textract, DynamoDB, OpenSearch writes.
AWS X‑Ray traces show full flow and latency breakdown.
Error handling for large/invalid files included.
Security & Cost Considerations
Least‑privilege IAM roles for each Lambda.
No hardcoded secrets — env vars & AWS Secrets Manager.
Encryption at rest + in transit.
Cognito authentication (optional).
Cost‑efficient serverless design — scales to zero when idle.
Future Improvements
Step Functions for orchestration.
NLP/ML enrichment with Comprehend, Bedrock, or SageMaker.
Semantic search with vector embeddings.
Advanced UI with previews and analytics.
Structured data extraction from forms/tables.
